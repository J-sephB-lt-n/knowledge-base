I was a skeptic for a very long time, but it's become clear to me that I need to embrace AI-generated coding and become an expert in it (while not losing the ability to think for myself).

I've been very convinced this month by these approaches to AI coding:
1. https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents
2. [# Getting AI to Work in Complex Codebases (Dexter Horthy)](https://github.com/humanlayer/advanced-context-engineering-for-coding-agents/blob/main/ace-fca.md)

Facts I consider to be true (about LLMs and LLM coding agents):
