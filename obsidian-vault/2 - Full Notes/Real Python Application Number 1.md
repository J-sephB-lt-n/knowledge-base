**Why do you think you are a good fit for this particular role?**
1. I am a professional python developer
2. I am a published author
3. I am a big proponent of lifelong learning
4. I am a regular and long-time consumer of Real Python (Real Python & Data Elixir are my top 2). 

**What's your experience level with Python?**
Nuanced question! I write python code all day for my day job, and python is my go-to language for any software task. I'm extremely comfortable with it. I can get onto a 12-hour flight with no internet and happily write python all the way (and I do). I have reached a point of decreasing marginal utility in learning more about python, although there is of course an abundance which I have yet to learn (and am keen to). At the moment, I'm improving python and rust in tandem, because I am trying to get a deeper understanding at a systems level.  

**Which Python topics do you find the most interesting?**
- Software best practice (logging, testing, documentation, code style, environment/package management, version control, CI/CD etc.)
- Software design and architecture
- Statistics, Causality, Machine Learning, Large Language Models.
- Data Visualisation
- Web development
- Cloud (currently AWS & GCP)
* This is by no means an exhaustive list

**What are some writing samples that showcase your teaching, writing, and practical programming skills? Please include at least one link to a relevant writing sample
Some writing examples:
- I coauthored this school textbook, which has sold over 300,000 copies (and continues to): https://www.amazon.co.za/Study-Master-Creative-Learners-Grade/dp/1107671159 (this is one of three: grade 7, grade 8, grade 9).
- https://www.selabs.tech/blog/are-you-smarter-than-a-llm
- https://j-sephb-lt-n.github.io/exploring_statistics/cuped_cupac_and_other_variance_reduction_techniques.html (I'm very sorry about the page load speed - I will rebuild this old rubbish website at some point). 

Some code examples:
- Data Batcher I used before itertools.batch came out: https://github.com/J-sephB-lt-n/joes_giant_toolbox/blob/main/joes_giant_toolbox/all/data_batcher.py
- Simple python search system I use to store and retrieve my own useful code snippets: https://github.com/J-sephB-lt-n/useful-code-snippets
- Rules-based classifier model: https://github.com/J-sephB-lt-n/joes_giant_toolbox/blob/main/joes_giant_toolbox/all/regex_rules_classifier.py
- Wrapper for pattern-based try/except handling: https://github.com/J-sephB-lt-n/joes_giant_toolbox/blob/main/joes_giant_toolbox/all/retry_function_call.py
- There are millions more in my github (https://github.com/J-sephB-lt-n)

**Anything else you'd like to tell us?**
1. I love Real Python. I read it often. Not all of the articles are relevant to my level any more, but the quality is consistently high.
2. If I am not selected, I would love feedback please. I am on a mission to continuously improve, and I am hungry for feedback (negative criticism is totally fine).
