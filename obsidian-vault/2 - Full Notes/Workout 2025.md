With the kids, I still don't have a lot of time. This is my plan for the next few months (starting October 2024):

The plan is:
- The [reddit r/bodyweightfitness Recommended Routine (RR)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine), but split into upper/lower on different days
- Possibly incorporating some dumbells
- max 30 minute workouts
- 2 runs per week (usually 1 will be friday football)
## Upper Workout (Pullup, Dip, Row, Pushup)
4x 
	- 10 pullups (when easy, proceed to weighted pullups)
	- whatever's left of 90 seconds is rest
	- 8 ring dips (when easy, proceed to weighted dips), or 15 pbar dips
	- whatever's left of 90 seconds is rest
4x
	- 8 incline rows on rings (make harder by moving more horizontal)
	- whatever's left of 90 seconds is rest
	- 12 pushups (on rings, diamonds, pseudo planche, or paralettes)
	- whatever's left of 90 seconds is rest
## Lower workout (Squat, Hinge, Core)
3x
	- 10 bulgarian split squats each side
	- whatever's left of 90 seconds is rest
	- 8 nordic curls
	- whatever's left of 90 seconds is rest
3x
	- 8 core compression lifts with lower back firmly to wall
		- (alt=front lever raises)
	- whatever's left of 60 seconds is rest
	- 8 copenhagen planks each side
	- whatever's left of 120 seconds is rest
	- 8 arch body holds (10 sec on, 10 sec off)
