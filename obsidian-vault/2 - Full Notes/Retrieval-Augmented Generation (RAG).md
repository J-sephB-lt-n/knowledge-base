Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) refers to the process of including additional contextual information in the prompt of a generative language model, fetched from an external knowledge base (information source). This gives the language model direct access to information which might answer the user's query, rather than needed to access it's own "knowledge.", greatly helping to reduce hallucination.
