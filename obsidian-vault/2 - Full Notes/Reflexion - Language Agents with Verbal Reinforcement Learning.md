_Reflexion_ is a conceptual framework enabling LLM agents to learn in a [Reinforcement Learning](Reinforcement%20Learning.md) context. Specifically, a LLM interacts with an environment repeatedly over multiple trials, improving in performance with each trial.

How _Reflexion_ works is that a LLM is used to generate feedback/observations/reflection after each trial (in natural language) and this information is made available to the action-making LLM on subsequent trials.
