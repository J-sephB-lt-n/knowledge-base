_Buy 'Til You Die_ (BTYD) is a family of highly interpretable probabilistic models used to estimate/forecast [Customer Lifetime Value (CLV,CLTV)](Customer%20Lifetime%20Value%20(CLV,CLTV).md) from basic RFM metrics.
Wikipedia describes them as ["a class ofÂ statistical models ... designed to capture the behavioral characteristics of non-contractual customers"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buy_Till_you_Die).

BTYD models typical assumptions/workings are as follows:
- Customers continue to buy (in a stochastic but predictable way) until a certain point, at which point they cease to buy (i.e. churn or, from the perspective of the model, "die").
- Each of a customer's... 
	- frequency of purchasing
	- purchase amounts
	- probability of being churned/dead 
- ...are assumed drawn from probabilistic univariate distributions estimated uniquely for each customer.
