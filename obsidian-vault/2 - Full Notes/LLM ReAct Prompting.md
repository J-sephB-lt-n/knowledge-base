(paper) ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models (https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629)

_ReAct prompting_ is a prompting style used to induce reasoning from LLMs in an [[LLM Agents]] system. 

_ReAct prompting_ involves inducing the large language model to solve a problem through multiple _thought-action-observation_ steps. This is achieved through _few-shot prompting_ i.e. showing the LLM several examples of what it should be doing first. 

Here is an example prompt from the original paper:
