## Proxy Server 
A proxy server is a middleman server between client (request) and server (response). 

```mermaid

    Client -->|Request| ProxyServer -->|Forwarded Request| DestinationServer
    DestinationServer -->|Response| ProxyServer -->|Forwarded Response| Client
```

A _proxy server_ simply relays communication back and forth between client and destination server. The destination server can see the IP address of the proxy server but not the client IP address (unless the Proxy server intentionally forwards the client IP address).

## VPN (Virtual Private Network)
A _VPN_ consists of both _VPN client_ (local encryption/decryption software) and _VPN server_.
The _VPN_ uses it's own encryption method, making the network traffic unintelligible to the client's Internet Service Provider (ISP).

```mermaid

	Client -->|<span style="font-size: 1.5em;">üëÅÔ∏è</span>request| VPNclient
	VPNclient -->|<span style="font-size: 1.5em;">üëÅÔ∏è</span>forwarded response| Client
	VPNclient -->|<span style="font-size: 1.5em;">üîí</span>forwarded request| ISP
	ISP -->|<span style="font-size: 1.5em;">üîí</span>forwarded response| VPNclient
	ISP -->|<span style="font-size: 1.5em;">üîí</span>forwarded request| VPNServer
	VPNServer -->|<span style="font-size: 1.5em;">üîí</span>forwarded response| ISP
	VPNServer -->|<span style="font-size: 1.5em;">üëÅÔ∏è</span>forwarded request| DestinationServer
	DestinationServer -->|<span style="font-size: 1.5em;">üëÅÔ∏è</span>response| VPNServer
```
The destination server (e.g. website) cannot see the IP address of the client, but only the IP address of the _VPN server_. _VPNs_ typically share a pool of IP addresses amongst their users.
