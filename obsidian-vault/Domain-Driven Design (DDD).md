[Domain-Driven Design (DDD)](Domain-Driven%20Design%20(DDD).md) is an approach to software design first described in the 2003 book [Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/domain-driven-design-tackling/0321125215/) by Eric Evans.
DDD revolves around modelling the business domain directly in the model code.

The main characteristics of DDD are:
- The domain (business problem space) is the core concern, and is explicitly modelled in the code i.e. "business-driven development".
- Code, documentation, meetings, team (devs and non-devs) and everything else uses the same *ubiquitous language* (i.e. shared vocabulary).
- The domain is subdivided into logical hard-scoped *bounded contexts*.

DDD is an approach, not an architecture. It can be implemented under different architectures (e.g. layered, service-oriented, hexagonal, event-driven etc.).

| Strategic | [Subdomains and Bounded Contexts](#Subdomains%20and%20Bounded%20Contexts) | - A *SUBDOMAIN* is a logical partition of the domain within which the software exists. It subdivides the problem space (the business).<br>*Subdomains* already exist (i.e. before we even consider code).<br>- A *BOUNDED CONTEXT* is a logical division of the solution space of the domain (the software model). It is a model and linguistic boundary within which it's own unique [Ubiquitous Language](#Ubiquitous%20Language) is valid (the same word can have a different meaning in another *bounded context*).<br>- A nice analogy is `COUNTRY=domain`, `REGIONS=functional areas of the country` and `BOUNDED CONTEXTS=different maps drawn of the country (e.g. a road map, a political map, a topological map etc.)`<br>- *SUBDOMAINS* and *BOUNDED CONTEXTS* sometimes coincide or overlap or have a superset/subset relationship, but this is not a requirement. <br>e.g. subdomain *Customer* or *Product* will likely appear in multiple different *Bounded Contexts* , with different attributes, rules and behaviours. |

## Subdomains and Bounded Contexts

TODO
## Ubiquitous Language

TODO

## Aggregates

- An *INVARIANT* is a business rule which must always be true e.g. *"An order cannot be paid twice."*
- *INVARIANTs* are enforced using an *AGGREGATE*.

## OLD STUFF

[Domain-Driven Design (DDD)](Domain-Driven%20Design%20(DDD).md) is an approach to software design whose central tenets are:
- `COLLABORATION`: The software’s design is driven by deep and ongoing collaboration between the developers and the domain experts.
- Strategic DDD
	- `UBIQUITOUS LANGUAGE`: The application code mirrors the language and structure of the problem/business domain being modelled (i.e. both code and problem domain use the same *ubiquitous* language).
	- `BOUNDED CONTEXTS`: Complex systems are broken into clearly defined [bounded contexts](Bounded%20contexts.md), each with its own model and language.
	- `CONTEXT MAPPING`: Relationships between bounded contexts are explicitly managed (e.g., anticorruption layers, shared kernels, customer-supplier).
	- `CORE DOMAIN FOCUS`: Effort is prioritized on the core domain—what provides genuine competitive advantage—while supporting subdomains may use simpler approaches.
- Tactical DDD
	- `TACTICAL BUILDING BLOCKS`: The model is expressed using specific patterns: Entities, Value Objects, Aggregates, Domain Events, Repositories, and Services.
