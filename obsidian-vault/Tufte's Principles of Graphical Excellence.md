These principles are from the book _The Visual Display of Quantitative Information_ by Edward Tufte.

|     | Principle                                                                                                                                             | Explanation |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| 1   | Show the Data                                                                                                                                         |             |
| 2   | Induce the viewer to think about the substance rather than about methodology, graphic design, the technology of graphic production, or something else |             |
| 3   | Avoid distorting what the data have to say                                                                                                            |             |
| 4   | Present many numbers in a small space                                                                                                                 |             |
| 5   | Make large datasets coherent                                                                                                                          |             |
| 6   | Encourage the eye to compare different pieces of data                                                                                                 |             |
| 7   | Reveal the data at several levels of detail, from a broad overview to a fine structure                                                                |             |
| 8   | Serve a reasonably clear purpose: description, exploration, tabulation, or decoration                                                                 |             |
