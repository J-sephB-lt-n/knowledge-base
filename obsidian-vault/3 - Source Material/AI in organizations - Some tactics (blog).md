Big takeaway for me from this blog post:
* You should keep your own suite of business-specific benchmarks which objectively measure how performant LLMs are at problems directly relevant your organisation. These can be rerun whenever a new model or framework comes out, to see if it is hype or actually useful.  

Summary:
* Lots of individuals are using LLMs a lot and achieving big productivity gains, but organisations are struggling to benefit from them. 
* There are many reasons for this (article lists many plausible ones).
* The article lists possible solutions to the problem
