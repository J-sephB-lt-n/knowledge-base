| Reverse Interviewing                    | Prompting the LLM to ask us questions. This helps unlock our human creativity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | https://openai.com/chatgpt/use-cases/writing-with-ai/                                                                |
| LLM Prompt Review                       | Instead of simply doing what you have told it to do, ask the LLM to comment on the quality/ambiguity of the task (prompt) that it has been given.<br>Possibly, ask the LLM to rewrite the required task (prompt) more clearly and unambiguously.<br>If the model gets a task wrong, ask it to explain why it got it wrong, and ask it to improve the prompt so that this mistake can be avoided in future.                                                                                                                         | [Anthropic: AI prompt engineering: A deep dive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9aRN5JkmL8)                         |
| Iterate with the model                  | A multi-step back and forth conversation between the user and the model can lead to a much better final output.<br>You can ask the model why it made a particular decision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                      |
| Model Persona/Role                      | Tell the LLM that they are a specific person or thing e.g. "You are a professional data analyst."<br>Note that this can sometimes degrade the quality of the model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [Anthropic: AI prompt engineering: A deep dive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9aRN5JkmL8)                         |
| Honesty                                 | Tell the model exactly what they are and what their context is e.g. "You are a large language model being used as a customer-facing chatbot on a banking website."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [Anthropic: AI prompt engineering: A deep dive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9aRN5JkmL8)                         |
| Treat it like a person                  | With a very large model, it's often worth prompting it as you would prompt an actual person to do a task.<br>Specifically, a very competent person (e.g. a consultant) with a lot of world knowledge, but no context about the problem that you want them to solve.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [Anthropic: AI prompt engineering: A deep dive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9aRN5JkmL8)                         |
| Chain-of-Thought                        | A prompting technique which involves trying to get the LLM to arrive at an answer via a _chain-of-thought_ i.e. a "_coherent series of intermediate reasoning steps that lead to the final answer_" (a step-by-step thought process).<br>The original paper proposed to achieve this by providing the model with a small number of solved examples before giving it its required task (i.e. include in its prompt a few example prompts+responses in which the answer was arrived at in a specific chain-of-thought fashion). <br> | https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903<br>                                                                                 |
| Chain-of-thought with self-consistency  | LLM is prompted as with standard chain-of-thought (i.e. some explars in the prompt).<br>Multiple independent and diverse responses are sampled from the LLM.<br>The most common answer is considered the correct one (the intuition being that mistakes are more likely to lead to different answers).<br>This of course is only applicable to problems with a mechanism for determining which LLM answers are in agreement or conflict.                                                                                           | https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11171                                                                                     |
| 1-shot and Few shot                     | Including in the prompt one (or a small number) of examples of correctly solved tasks, prior to giving it its actual task.<br>This can be used to show the model the way that it should approach (or "think about") the task that it is required to solve.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                      |
| Include emotional stimuli in the prompt | Including emotional stimuli at the end of the prompt can increase model performance<br>examples:<br>"This is very important to my career."<br>"Are you sure that's your final answer? It might be worth taking another look."<br>"Take pride in your work and give it your best. Your commitment to excellence sets you apart."                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Paper: [Large Language Models Understand and Can be Enhanced by Emotional Stimuli](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11760) |
