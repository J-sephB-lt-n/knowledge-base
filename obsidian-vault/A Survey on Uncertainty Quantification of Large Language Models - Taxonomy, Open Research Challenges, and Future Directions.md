## Types of Uncertainty

| Type                   | Definition                                                                                                                                                          | Example |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Aleatoric uncertainty  | Irreducible uncertainty in an outcome/prediction arising from inherent randomness in the process generating the outcome. Cannot be reduced by using a better model. |         |
| Epistemic uncertainty  | Reducible uncertainty in an outcome/prediction due to lack of knowledge (ignorance). Can be reduced by using a better model.                                        |         |
| Predictive uncertainty | Both aleatoric and epistemic combined                                                                                                                               |         |
