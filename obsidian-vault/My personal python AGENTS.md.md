# General Principles
You must always write code that (where relevant) fulfils all of the requirements of high quality code:
	- **Functionality (correctness)** : Works as expected and fulfills its intended purpose.
	- **Readability**: Is easy for humans to quickly comprehend (code is optimised for clarity).
	- **Documentation**: Clearly explains its purpose and usage.
	- **Standards Compliance**: Adheres to conventions and guidelines (e.g. PEP 8 for python code).
	- **Reusability**: Can be used in different contexts without modification.
	- **Maintainability**: Allows for modifications and extensions without introducing bugs.
	- **Robustness**: Handles errors and unexpected inputs effectively.
	- **Testability**: Can be easily verified for correctness.
	- **Efficiency**: Optimizes time and resource usage.
	- **Scalability**: Handles increased data loads or complexity without degradation.
	- **Security**: Protects against vulnerabilities and malicious inputs.
- Aim for high cohesion within modules and low coupling between them.
- Unless you are only providing a single argument and it is obvious what that argument is, always use named arguments when calling a function. 


# Documentation
- All codebases should have a README.md file at the project root. It must be a brief but  information dense document (optimised for human-readability) containing important context for understanding the application, intended to provide new developers with sufficient information to begin contributing to the codebase. It should include:
	  - The name of the application
	  - A high-level description of the primary goal(s) of the application
	  - Instructions on how to setup and run the application (and test suite).
	  - An explanation of the layout of the codebase 
- Comments should be used sparingly. As far as possible, code should be self-documenting. Here are some general principles which often help:
	- Descriptive naming.
	- Complex logic broken down into well-named single-responsibility chunks (clean abstractions).
	- Use named constants.
	- No magic numbers (use named constants instead).
# Software Testing
- I don't believe in 100% test coverage, but please identify parts of the code which would be made more robust by adding tests and raise these with me.
- The test suite is going to consist of hundreds of tests, so ensure that no individual unit test takes more than 1 second to run.
# Python-specific
- Type annotate everything.
	- Make the type annotations as readable as possible (prioritise readability over comprehensiveness).
	- Don't use typing.Dict, typing.List, typing.Tuple etc. (you can use the base types dict, list, tuple etc. in type annotations since python 3.9).
	- After working on a piece of code, use `uv run ty check` to check that your type annotations are correct (you may need to install `ty` using `uv add --dev ty`)
- All modules, classes and functions must have google-style docstrings.
- Use assert statements frequently as lightweight validation of the expected state of the system.
	- Always include a short assert message.
- Aim for high cohesion within modules and low coupling between them.
- Unless you are only providing a single argument and it is obvious what that argument is, always use named arguments when calling a function.
- Very long `.py` scripts are a code smell. Over 500 lines is a warning, but generally still ok if there is a good reason. Python scripts over 1000 lines require a strong justification. Obviously, one expects HTML, template files, data files like CSV etc. to be very long.
- Code should not be platform-specific e.g. filepaths should use `Path(...)` from `pathlib` not windows path strings.
## Python Error Handling 
- Exceptions are an important signal and should not be thoughtlessly suppressed.
- Unexpected program behaviour must raise an exception (don't try to catch developer mistakes with error-handling code).
- A bare try/except may only be used at the topmost end-user-facing level of the application (if at all). All other exceptions must bubble up.

## User Inputs 
- User inputs should always be assumed to be malicious.
