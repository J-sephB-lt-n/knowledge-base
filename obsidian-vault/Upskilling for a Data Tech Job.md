Here are my thoughts on acquiring skills which are important for career progression/proficiency 

| thought      | description                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SQL          | Essential to know SQL well (not difficult!)                                                                                                                       |
| python       | you can build anything using the core library                                                                                                                     |
| newsletters  | subscribe to people who are good at what they do (data elixir, real python, )                                                                                     |
| linux/unix   | Typing is faster than clicking, and the terminal is available everywhere (e.g. on a new VM). If your dev setup is the terminal, you'll be comfortable everywhere. |
| web security | OWASP is a great place to start                                                                                                                                   |
