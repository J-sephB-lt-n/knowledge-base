- Plan out the entire project beforehand. Clearly specify everything:
	- Overall
	- Folder/file structure
	- Languages/frameworks to be used
	- Where the project root is
	- All aspects of the UI. What are the pages, what are the buttons etc.
	- Naming conventions
	- Anything else you can think of
- Generate functional requirements and user stories first, and include this information
- ALWAYS ASK FOR EXTREME LOGGING AND ERROR HANDLING EVERYWHERE AND ALL PLACES. Add the request in all bold. This makes iteration much easier.
- Test everything frequently and give the model a lot of detailed feedback (both what works and what does not work)
-
